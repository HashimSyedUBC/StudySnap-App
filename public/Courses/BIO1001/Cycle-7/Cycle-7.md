### Cycle 7: Genetic Variation, Reproductive Strategies, and Hermaphroditism

#### Lecture 14 Outcomes

#### 1. How Recombination Contributes to Population Genetic Variation

- **Recombination:**
  - Does not create new alleles but generates new combinations of existing alleles across multiple loci.
  - Example combinations: AB, ab, Ab, aB.
  - Results in offspring with potentially more beneficial combinations of alleles, leading to higher fitness.

- **Genetic Lottery:**
  - Individuals with advantageous allele combinations are more fit and their genotypes become more common over time through natural selection.

#### 2. Meanings of Monoecious and Dioecious

- **Monoecious (Hermaphrodites):**
  - Organisms with both male and female reproductive parts in the same individual.
  - Example: Flowering plants like roses have both stamens (male) and pistils (female) in the same flower.
  - **Parthenogenesis:** Reproduction from an ovum without fertilization, common in some invertebrates and lower plants.

- **Dioecious:**
  - Species with separate male and female individuals.
  - Example: Humans, where males and females are separate individuals who must mate to combine gametes.

#### 3. Difference Between Sequential and Simultaneous Monoecy

- **Simultaneous Monoecy:**
  - Individuals have both male and female reproductive systems throughout their entire life.
  - Example: Certain plant species with flowers that produce both male and female gametes simultaneously.

- **Sequential Monoecy:**
  - Individuals start as one sex and change to the other at a certain stage or size.
  - **Protandry:** Individuals start as males and switch to females.
    - Example: Clownfish (Nemo) start as males and turn into females later.
  - **Protogyny:** Individuals start as females and switch to males.
    - Example: Many coral reef fish start as females and switch to males when they reach a certain size.

#### 4. Examples and Predictions of the Size-Advantage Model of Sex Change

- **Size-Advantage Model of Sex Change:**
  - Depending on an individual's size, it may be more beneficial to be either a female or a male.
  - **Example: Coral Reef Fish**
    - More beneficial to be female when small and male when large.
    - When an individual becomes the largest in the population, it switches from female to male (protogyny).

- **Graphing the Relationship:**
  - A graph can show the relationship between size and reproductive success for each sex.
  - The point where the curves for male and female reproductive success cross is the threshold body size, the optimal time to switch from one sex to the other.

#### 5. Examples and Predictions of Adaptive Sex Ratio Manipulation

- **Adaptive Sex Ratio Manipulation:**
  - The sex ratio is adjusted based on the mother's condition.
  - Usual sex ratio is 1 son to 1 daughter (1:1).

  **Examples:**
  - **Red Deer:**
    - Healthy mothers produce more males; unhealthy mothers produce more females.
  - **Baboons:**
    - Male baboons leave their groups while females stay.
    - Healthy mothers are more likely to produce females; unhealthy mothers are more likely to produce males, who will leave the group.

#### 6. Prevalence of Sexual vs. Asexual Reproduction

- **Asexual Reproduction:**
  - Most forms of life reproduce asexually.
  - Asexual reproduction is evolutionarily ancient.
  
- **Sexual Reproduction:**
  - Plants and animals primarily reproduce sexually.
  - **Isogamy:** Equal-sized gametes appeared first.
  - **Anisogamy:** Unequal gametes developed later.
  - Asexual reproduction in animals evolved more recently.

#### 7. Costs and Benefits of Reproducing Sexually vs. Asexually

**Costs of Sexual Reproduction:**
  - **Energy and Effort:**
    - Finding mates, competing for mates, etc.
    - Meiosis creates offspring with only about half of the parent's genome.
  - **Decreased Fitness:**
    - Attracting mates can attract predators (e.g., singing males).
  - **Males as a Dead End:**
    - Only females produce offspring, making males less efficient for reproduction.
  - **Summary:**
    - Cost of mating, cost of meiosis, and cost of males.

**Benefits of Sexual Reproduction:**
  - **Genetic Diversity:**
    - Allows recombination to produce offspring without deleterious mutations.
    - Offspring with fewer deleterious mutations have a selective advantage ("Rubies in the rubbish").
  - **Population Health:**
    - Prevents the buildup of harmful mutations, reducing extinction risk.
  
#### 8. Benefits of Sexual Reproduction: Muller's Ratchet, Lottery Principle, and Red Queen Principle

- **Muller's Ratchet ("Rubies in the Rubbish"):**
  - Sexual reproduction creates genetic variation, allowing for individuals with fewer deleterious mutations to survive and reproduce.

- **Lottery Principle:**
  - **Strategy in Stable Environment:**
    - Asexual reproduction is like buying many copies of the same ticket.
  - **Strategy in Changing Environment:**
    - Sexual reproduction hedges bets by producing varied offspring, increasing chances of success.
    - Similar to diversifying investments in the stock market.

- **Red Queen Principle:**
  - "It takes all the running you can do, to stay in the same place."
  - Metaphor for the co-evolutionary arms race between species.
  - **Parasitic Infections:**
    - Hosts with rare genotypes have a selective advantage.
    - Sexual reproduction produces new and rare allele combinations, beneficial in environments with many parasites.
    - Rapidly producing different genotypes helps combat evolving parasites.


### Lecture 15 Outcomes: Sexual Selection and Reproductive Strategies

#### 1. Sexual Reproduction and Different Selective Forces on Males vs. Females

- **Different Selection Pressures:**
  - Sexual reproduction imposes different selection pressures on males and females.
  - **Male Fitness:**
    - Increases by mating with as many females as possible (offspring quantity).
  - **Female Fitness:**
    - Increases by selecting high-quality males to ensure better offspring (offspring quality).

- **Traits Expressed by One Sex:**
  - Some traits evolve to attract the opposite sex.
  - These traits are often sexually dimorphic, meaning they are only expressed by one sex.
  - Examples: Male peacock's feathers, male deer antlers.

#### 2. Distinction Between Intrasexual and Intersexual Selection

- **Intrasexual Selection:**
  - Direct competition between members of the same sex (usually males) for access to mates.
  - Examples: Male-male combat, such as fighting with horns or antlers.

- **Intersexual Selection:**
  - Indirect competition where individuals of one sex (usually females) select mates based on certain traits.
  - Examples: Females choosing males with flashy tail feathers or beautiful songs.

#### 3. Reasons for Male Competition for Access to Females

- **Male Competition:**
  - Males usually compete for females because males can produce many offspring with multiple mates, increasing their fitness.
  - Females have limited reproductive capacity and invest more in offspring, so they are selective about mates.

- **Examples of Intrasexual and Intersexual Selection:**
  - **Bower Birds:**
    - **Intersexual Selection:** Females prefer blue objects and dislike red.
    - **Intrasexual Selection:** Males sabotage rivals by destroying nests or placing red feathers in them.

- **Reversal of Typical Patterns:**
  - In some species, roles are reversed.
  - Example: In species where males invest more in offspring care, females may compete for males.

### Lecture 15 Outcomes (Continued): Sexual Selection, Fitness, and Parental Investment

#### 4. Which Sex Usually Has Higher Potential Fitness

- **Potential Fitness:**
  - Refers to the potential reproductive success of an individual.
  
- **Males vs. Females:**
  - **Males:**
    - Have higher potential fitness because they can sire many offspring.
    - Invest less in producing offspring (e.g., sperm is less costly than eggs).
    - The most successful male in a population can produce many more offspring than the most successful female.
    - The least successful male produces fewer offspring than the least successful female.
    - Exhibit greater variation in reproductive success.
  - **Females:**
    - Have lower potential fitness due to the higher cost of producing eggs and caring for offspring.
    - Invest more in offspring quality (e.g., egg production, parental care).

- **Key Points:**
  - Both males and females have equal average fitness because every offspring has one male and one female parent.
  - There is more variation in male fitness, with some males having very high reproductive success and others having very low.
  - The reproductive success of males is more variable, whereas females tend to have more consistent reproductive success.

#### 5. Which Sex Has Higher Average Fitness?

- **Average Fitness:**
  - Both males and females have equal average fitness.
  - Every offspring has one male parent and one female parent, ensuring that on average, the fitness of males and females is balanced across the population.

#### 6. Relationship Between Sexual Selection and Parental Investment

- **Parental Investment:**
  - The time and resources a parent expends for the benefit of their offspring.
  - The sex that invests more in parental care becomes a limiting resource for the sex that invests less.
  - Typically, females invest more in parental care, resulting in lower potential fitness but higher quality offspring.
  - Males invest less in parental care, resulting in higher potential fitness by increasing the number of mates.

- **Sexual Selection Dynamics:**
  - **High Investing Sex (Usually Females):**
    - Choosier about mates to ensure offspring quality.
    - Focus on direct benefits (e.g., food, protection, good territory) and indirect benefits (e.g., good genes).
  - **Low Investing Sex (Usually Males):**
    - Competes for access to the high investing sex.
    - Focuses on mating with as many partners as possible to maximize offspring quantity.

- **Reasons for Female Choosiness:**
  - **Direct Benefits:**
    - Attractive males may provide better resources, protection, or access to territories.
  - **Indirect Benefits:**
    - Attractive males may have good genes that improve offspring survival or attractiveness (e.g., good singers).
  - **"Sexy Sons" Hypothesis:**
    - Females prefer attractive males because they will have attractive sons who are more likely to reproduce successfully.

#### 7. Differences in Male and Female Responses to Short-Term Mating Opportunities

- **Differences in Female Priorities:**
  - **Long-Term Priorities:**
    - Females prioritize long-term benefits for their offspring.
    - Seek mates with traits that indicate good genes, such as attractiveness and athletic ability.
    - High investment in ensuring the partner provides resources, protection, and care.
  - **Short-Term Priorities:**
    - Lower priorities for short-term mating opportunities.
    - Females may look for indirect benefits like genetic quality from a short-term mate.
    - More concerned with emotional infidelity than physical infidelity, as emotional commitment indicates resource provision and stability.

- **Differences in Male Standards:**
  - **Long-Term Standards:**
    - Males have high standards for long-term mates, focusing on traits that indicate fidelity and the ability to care for offspring.
    - Concerned with securing a partner who will invest in their offspring.
  - **Short-Term Standards:**
    - Males have lower standards for short-term mating opportunities.
    - More focused on increasing the number of mating opportunities to maximize reproductive success.
    - More concerned with physical infidelity than emotional infidelity, as physical infidelity directly impacts paternity certainty.

#### Key Points

- **Emotional vs. Physical Infidelity:**
  - **Females:**
    - More bothered by emotional infidelity because it threatens the emotional bond and resource investment from their partner.
  - **Males:**
    - More bothered by physical infidelity because it directly affects their paternity certainty and the investment of resources in their own offspring.

- **Investment Strategies:**
  - **Females:**
    - Invest heavily in offspring and seek long-term stability and quality in mates.
  - **Males:**
    - Seek to maximize reproductive success through quantity in short-term opportunities and quality in long-term partnerships.
