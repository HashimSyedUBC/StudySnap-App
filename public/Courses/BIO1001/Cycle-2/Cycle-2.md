### Cycle 2 Outcomes: Genome Replication

#### 1) Phases & Main Characteristics of the Cell Cycle

**Mitosis:**

1. **Prophase:**
   - Chromatin condenses.
   - Nucleolus disappears, stopping RNA synthesis.
   - Mitotic spindle begins to form between the two centrosomes as they migrate to opposite sides of the cell.
   - Spindles develop microtubules that radiate from spindle poles.

2. **Prometaphase:**
   - Nuclear envelope breaks down.
   - Spindle microtubules grow from centrosomes.
   - Kinetochore, a complex protein, forms on each centromere.
   - Kinetochore microtubules bind to the kinetochore, pulling the chromatids to opposite sides.

3. **Metaphase:**
   - Spindle microtubules move the chromosomes to the metaphase plate (middle).
   - Chromosomes are fully condensed.

4. **Anaphase:**
   - Sister chromatids separate, being pulled at the kinetochore, and move to opposite spindle poles.

5. **Telophase:**
   - Spindles disassemble, and chromosomes decondense.
   - Nucleolus reappears.

#### 2) Stages & Main Characteristics of Mitosis

**Interphase:**
- **G1 Phase:** Cell functions are carried out; the cell may grow.
- **S Phase:** Chromosomes are replicated.
- **G2 Phase:** Cell grows and prepares for mitosis.

**Mitosis Stages:**

1. **Prophase:**
   - Chromosomes condense.
   - Nucleolus disappears.
   - Spindle fibers form and migrate.

2. **Prometaphase:**
   - Kinetochore forms.
   - Spindles enter the nuclear area and attach to the kinetochore.

3. **Metaphase:**
   - Microtubules move chromatids to the metaphase plate.

4. **Anaphase:**
   - Chromatids separate at the centromere and migrate to opposite ends.

5. **Telophase:**
   - Nuclear membranes form around chromosomes, which extend.

#### 3) Identifying Stages of Cell Division in Micrographs or Diagrams

**Cytokinesis:**
- Occurs near the end of mitosis, usually starting with telophase or the end of anaphase.
- In animals, protists, and some fungi, a furrow forms along the former spindle midpoint plane. Microfibers tighten like a belt, and daughter cells are pinched off from each other.
- In plants, layers of vesicles collect in the spindle midpoint plane, fuse together, and create a cell plate, dividing the two daughter cells.

#### 4) Changes in Amount of DNA Throughout the Cell Cycle

**Example Using Fruit Fly:**
- Start with 8 chromosomes.
- During the S phase of interphase, chromosomes are duplicated, forming sister chromatids.
- Number of chromosomes remains 8, but the number of DNA molecules doubles.
- During mitosis, sister chromatids split into two daughter cells, each having 8 chromosomes.
- The number of chromosomes never changes; the amount of DNA does.
- **C Number:** Represents the amount of DNA in a cell.
- **n Value:** Represents the number of complete sets of a cell's genome.

**Diploid Human Cell:**

| Stage of Cell Cycle | n Value                               | C Value                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|:----------------------------|
| G1 Phase            | 2n (23 chromosome pairs)              | 2C                          |
| S Phase             | 2n (23 chromosome pairs)              | 4C (due to DNA replication) |
| Pre-anaphase          | 2n (23 chromosome pairs)              | 4C                          |
| Telophase             | 2\\(2n\\) (sister chromatids separated) | 2(C)                       |
| Post-cytokinesis      | 2n (23 chromosome pairs)              | 2C (due to DNA segregation) |

#### 6) Examples of Situations in Which Cells Would Be Programmed to Die by Apoptosis
- If DNA is unbalanced or damaged.
- When there is a surplus of cells in an area.
- In xylem plant tissue (cells function when dead).
- When an organism dies (death signals prompt cell death).

#### 7) Main Features of Each Stage of Mitosis with Respect to Cytoskeleton and Chromatin
- **Prophase:** Chromatin condenses; spindle (microtubules) is produced.
- **Prometaphase:** Nuclear membrane disintegrates; centrosomes migrate.
- **Metaphase:** Microtubules attach to chromatids and pull them apart.
- **Anaphase:** Chromatids are separated to opposite poles by kinetochores.
- **Telophase:** Nuclear membrane forms around daughter chromatids.

#### 8) Main Features of Chromosome Anatomy
- Chromosomes are long, double-stranded DNA molecules.
- **Nuclear Chromosomes:** Linear.
- **Mitochondrial and Chloroplast Chromosomes:** Circular.
- **Centromere:** Middle portion of the chromosome; attracts kinetochore attachment.
- **Kinetochores:** Bind to microtubules to pull apart sister chromatids.

#### 9) Meaning of Genome, "n," and "C"
- **Genome:** All DNA sequences in one copy of an organism’s chromosomes.

- **Microfilaments:** Made of actin.

#### 12) Interaction Between Spindle Fibers and Kinetochores
- In metaphase, motor proteins attached to kinetochores grab onto the microtubules (spindle fibers) and pull the chromosomes along to either pole of the cell. The chromosomes pull themselves towards the spindle fiber.

#### 13) Role of Motor Proteins in Chromosome Segregation
- Motor proteins attached to kinetochores pull the chromosomes apart to the poles. They "walk" the kinetochore along the microtubules, which disassemble, pulling the chromosomes towards the poles.

#### 14) Role of Cell Cycle Checkpoints
- **Checkpoints:** Regulate the cell cycle.
  - **First Checkpoint:** Before S phase; ensures DNA is repaired before replication.
  - **Second Checkpoint:** Before mitosis; ensures chromosomes are condensed and ready.
  - **Third Checkpoint:** After metaphase, before anaphase; ensures chromatids are properly lined up before separation.

  - In both DNA and RNA: Guanine pairs with cytosine.

#### 2) Design, Outcome, and Conclusions of the Classic Meselson and Stahl Experiment
- **Experiment Design:** Used "heavy" nitrogen to label DNA in E. coli, then transferred to a "light" nitrogen medium. DNA samples were taken at intervals, centrifuged in CsCl to produce a density gradient.
- **Outcomes:**
  - After one round of replication: DNA was hybrid weight.
  - After two rounds: Two bands formed, one light and one hybrid.
- **Conclusion:** DNA replication is semiconservative.

#### 3) Direction of Movement of DNA Polymerase on the Template Strand
- DNA polymerase moves along the template strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction.
- The new DNA strand is synthesized in the 5’ to 3’ direction.

#### 4) Key Terms in DNA Replication
- **Bi-directional:** DNA strands are antiparallel; one goes 3’ to 5’, the other 5’ to 3’.
- **Semi-conservative:** Each new DNA molecule has one parent strand and one new strand.
- **Semi-discontinuous:** Leading strand synthesized continuously, lagging strand synthesized in fragments.
- **Leading Strand:** Synthesized continuously in the 5’ to 3’ direction along with the replication fork.
- **Lagging Strand:** Synthesized discontinuously in 5’ to 3’ direction, forming Okazaki fragments.

#### 5) General Action of Proteins in DNA Replication
- **Helicase:** Unwinds double helix.
- **SSBs (Single-Strand Binding Proteins):** Keep single strands apart.
- **Topoisomerase:** Prevents twisting of DNA.
- **Primase:** Adds RNA primer to DNA strand for synthesis initiation.
- **DNA Polymerase III:** Synthesizes DNA in 5’ to 3’ direction.
- **Sliding Clamp:** Tethers DNA Polymerase III to DNA strand.
- **DNA Polymerase I:** Removes RNA primer and replaces with DNA.
- **Ligase:** Seals bonds between Okazaki fragments.
- **Telomerase:** Extends the 3’ end of the template strand with a repetitive DNA sequence.

#### 6) 3' vs. 5' Polarity of Nucleic Acid Chains Involved in DNA Replication
- **3’ End:** Has an OH group attached.
- **5’ End:** Has a phosphate group attached.
- DNA can only be added to the 3’ end of a strand.

#### 7) Components Necessary for DNA Synthesis
- One replisome containing all necessary enzymes: DNA Polymerase, primase, DNA ligase, topoisomerase, SSBs, etc.

#### 8) Direction of Elongation of a Given DNA Strand
- New strands elongate in the 5’ to 3’ direction.
- The template strand is read in the 3’ to 5’ direction.
- Elongation is bi-directional, forming two replication forks traveling in opposite directions.

#### 9) Why Chromosomes Shorten at Each Replication
- When RNA primers are removed, there is no 3’ end for DNA polymerase I to attach new nucleotides, resulting in a single-stranded end on the lagging strand.

#### 10) Mechanism by Which Telomerase Adds Telomeres to Chromosomes
- Telomerase extends the 3’ end of a chromosome using its RNA template.
- The RNA template attaches to the parent strand and synthesizes new DNA.
- This process repeats, preventing telomere shortening.
