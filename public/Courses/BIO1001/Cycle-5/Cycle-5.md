### Cycle 5: Mendel's Work and Genetic Principles

#### 1. Characteristics of Mendel's Work That Set Him Apart as a Genetic Researcher

- **Experiments on Pea Plants:**
  - Gregor Mendel's experiments with pea plants in the 1860s provided answers on how traits were inherited through offspring.
  - He contradicted the blending theory of inheritance, which suggested that traits blend evenly through the mixing of parents' blood.
  - Mendel studied inheritable characteristics (characters) and their variations (traits).
  - He did not know that the segregation of chromosomes to gametes influenced inheritance patterns.
  - Unique because he approached the study of characteristics in a statistical and quantitative way.

#### 2. Components of Mendel's Explanatory Model

- **Cross Pollination:**
  - Mendel prevented self-fertilization by cutting off the anthers of pea plants and used an anther from one plant to pollinate the stigma of another. This method is called cross-pollination.
  - The plants used were true-breeding, meaning they passed traits without change from one generation to the next when self-fertilized.
  - The seeds resulting from these experiments were analyzed for traits like smooth or wrinkled texture and flower color.

- **Results of Cross Pollination:**
  - F1 generation showed the same traits as the parental (P) generation (e.g., purple flowers).
  - F2 generation exhibited a 3:1 ratio of purple to white flowers.

- **Mendel's Theories:**
  1. **First Theory:**
     - Adult plants carry a pair of factors (genes) that govern the inheritance of each character.
     - Different versions of a gene that produce different traits of a character are called alleles (two alleles of one gene govern traits).
  2. **Second Theory:**
     - If an individual's pair of genes consists of different alleles, one allele is dominant over the other (recessive).
     - Dominant alleles code for functional enzymes and determine the phenotype, while recessive alleles code for non-functional enzymes.
  3. **Third Theory (Principle of Segregation):**
     - As gametes are formed, half carry one allele and the other half carry the other allele.
     - A zygote receives one allele from each parent gamete.

- **Three Results of Mendel's Experiment:**
  1. Genes that govern genetic characters are present in two copies in individuals.
  2. If different alleles are present in an individualâ€™s pair of genes, one allele is dominant over the other.
  3. The two alleles of a gene segregate and enter gametes singly.

#### 3. Distribution of Progeny Given Parental Genotypes in Crosses

- **Monohybrid Cross Progeny Distribution:**
  - 1/4 homozygous dominant
  - 1/2 heterozygous
  - 1/4 homozygous recessive

- **Sex-Linked Traits:**
  - Traits carried on the X chromosome affect both X chromosomes in females but only one in males.

#### 4. Parental Genotypes Given Distribution of Progeny in Crosses

- **Monohybrid Cross:**
  - Mating between two individuals with different alleles at one genetic locus.
  - Characters studied are governed by two or multiple alleles on homologous chromosomes.

#### 5. Location of Various Alleles on Homologues

- **Locus:**
  - The specific site on a chromosome where a gene is located is called the locus.
  - Alleles are located at the same locus on each homologous pair.
  - During gamete formation (Meiosis I), pairs of alleles separate.
  - Half of the gametes carry one allele, and the other half carry the other allele.
  - During fertilization, the zygote receives one allele from each parent.

#### 6. Chromosome Theory of Inheritance

- **Genes and Alleles:**
  - Genes and alleles are carried on chromosomes, as proposed by Walton Sutton.


#### 7. Number of Different Gametes Produced, Given Parental Genotype

- **Monohybrid Cross:**
  - Phenotypic ratio: 3:1 (e.g., Rr x Rr)
  - Possible gametes: R and r

- **Dihybrid Cross:**
  - Phenotypic ratio: 9:3:3:1 (e.g., RrWw x RrWw)
  - Possible gametes: RW, Rw, rW, rw

#### 8. Arrangement of Genes and Alleles on Homologous Chromosomes in a Dihybrid Organism

- **Dihybrid Organism:**
  - A zygote produced from a cross involving two characters, heterozygous for two traits (e.g., RrWw).
  - Genes for each character are located on different homologous pairs (e.g., one gene on chromosome 6 and another on chromosome 8).
  - Genes can also be located at different loci on the same homologous chromosome.
  - Separation during meiosis and gamete formation follows the principle of independent assortment.

#### 9. How Independent Assortment Creates Four Different Products of Meiosis from a Dihybrid Parent

- **Independent Assortment:**
  - During meiosis, the alleles of genes governing two characteristics segregate independently.
  - Random alignment of homologous chromosome pairs ensures that R alleles can pair with either Y or y alleles in gametes.
  - This results in four different gametes (e.g., RW, Rw, rW, rw).

#### 10. Application of the Sum and Product Rule of Probability

- **Product Rule:**
  - Probability that two or more independent events will occur together.
  - Multiply individual probabilities.
  - Example: Probability of having four girls in a row is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \).

- **Sum Rule:**
  - Probability of several different events resulting in the same outcome.
  - Add the probabilities of the different events.
  - Example: Probability of rolling a total of 7 with two dice is \( \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \).

#### 11. Pattern of Offspring Expected Given Mechanism of Epistasis

- **Epistasis:**
  - Interaction between genes where one gene masks or inhibits the effect of another gene at a different locus.
  - Example: In Labrador retrievers, allele E allows pigment deposition, while ee blocks pigment deposition, making the fur yellow. E is epistatic to the B gene, which determines black or brown fur.\

#### 12. Distinction Between Codominance and Incomplete Dominance

- **Incomplete Dominance:**
  - Effects of recessive alleles are detectable in heterozygotes (blending).
  - Example: Red and white flowers producing pink flowers.
  - Example: Sickle cell trait in heterozygotes (milder form of disease).

- **Codominance:**
  - Both alleles have equal effects and are equally detectable in heterozygotes.
  - Example: Blood type, where both A and B alleles are expressed.

#### 13. Polygenic Traits and Non-"Blended" Inheritance

- **Polygenic Inheritance:**
  - Multiple genes contribute to a single character (e.g., height, skin color, body weight).
  - Distribution of traits resembles a bell curve.
  - Example: Children not being intermediate in traits compared to their parents.
  - Environment can influence the expression of these traits (e.g., nutrition affecting growth).

#### 14. Description of Pleiotropic Genes

- **Pleiotropy:**
  - Single genes affect multiple characters of an organism.
  - Example: Sickle cell disease, which affects hemoglobin structure, causes blood vessel blockage, and produces a wide range of symptoms.

#### 15. Mechanism of X Inactivation for Dosage Compensation

- **X Inactivation:**
  - In females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated to equalize gene expression with males.
  - The inactive X chromosome forms a Barr body.
  - This ensures that the activity of most X-linked genes is the same in both sexes.
