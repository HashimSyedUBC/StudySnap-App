### Cycle 6: Genetic Principles and Phenotypic Variation

#### Prep Lecture 12 Outcomes

#### 1. Difference Between "Allele," "Locus," and "Gene Pool"

- **Allele:**
  - One of two or more versions of a gene.

- **Locus:**
  - The specific site on a chromosome where a gene is located.

- **Gene Pool:**
  - The sum of all alleles at all gene loci in all individuals within a population.

#### 2. Examples of Quantitative and Qualitative Variation

- **Quantitative Variation:**
  - Individuals differ in small increments, often due to polygenic traits.
  - Represented by a continuous distribution curve.
  - Example: Height in humans.

- **Qualitative Variation:**
  - Alleles exist in two or more discrete states with no intermediate forms.
  - Discrete variants of characters are called polymorphisms.
  - Example: Blood type in humans (A, B, AB, O).

#### 3. Importance of Understanding the Causes of Phenotypic Variation

- **Genetic Differences:**
  - Variation due to differences in the genetic makeup of individuals.

- **Environmental Factors:**
  - Variation due to environmental influences, such as soil acidity affecting flower color.

- **Genetic and Environmental Interactions:**
  - Both genetic differences and environmental factors can interact to produce phenotypic variation.

- **Heritability and Evolutionary Change:**
  - Only genetic differences are heritable and subject to evolutionary change, making it important to distinguish the cause of variation.

#### 4. Testing the Causes of Phenotypic Variation

- **Controlled Experiments:**
  - Use genetically identical individuals in different environments to isolate environmental effects.
  
- **Common Garden Experiment:**
  - Grow different genotypes in the same environment to isolate genetic effects.

- **Twin Studies:**
  - Compare phenotypic differences between identical and fraternal twins to assess the relative contributions of genetics and environment.

#### 5. Meaning of "Allele Frequency" and "Genotype Frequency"

- **Genotype Frequency:**
  - The percentage of individuals in a population possessing a specific genotype.

- **Allele Frequency:**
  - The relative abundance of different alleles in a population.

#### 6. How to Calculate Allele Frequencies from Genotype Frequencies

1. **Determine Genotype Frequencies:**
   - Calculate the frequency of each genotype by dividing the number of individuals with that genotype by the total number of individuals in the sample.

2. **Calculate Total Number of Alleles:**
   - For a given allele, multiply the number of alleles present in one individual with a specific genotype by the number of individuals with that genotype.
   
   Example:
   - If the genotype frequencies are as follows:
     - \(RR = 0.25\)
     - \(Rr = 0.50\)
     - \(rr = 0.25\)

   - Calculate allele frequencies:
     - Frequency of \(R\) allele:
       - \( \text{Frequency of } R = \frac{(2 \times \text{Number of } RR) + (\text{Number of } Rr)}{2 \times \text{Total number of individuals}} \)
       - If we assume 100 individuals:
         - \( R = \frac{(2 \times 25) + 50}{200} = \frac{100}{200} = 0.5 \)
     - Frequency of \(r\) allele:
       - \( r = 1 - R = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \)

### Lecture 12 Outcomes: Dominance, Fitness, and Selection

#### 1. Dominance Status of an Allele Not Related to Fitness

- **Equal Fitness:**
  - If all genotypes have equal fitness, the dominance status of an allele does not affect its frequency over time.
  - The allele frequencies will remain stable as there is no selective advantage or disadvantage.

- **Selection Against Dominant Allele:**
  - When selection works against a dominant allele, its frequency will eventually reach 0.
  - This is because the dominant allele is expressed in both homozygotes and heterozygotes, making it unable to hide from selection.

#### 2. Dominance Status of an Allele Related to Fitness

- **Selection Against Recessive Allele:**
  - When selection works against a recessive allele, its frequency will decrease but not reach 0.
  - The recessive allele can "hide" in heterozygotes, allowing harmful recessive alleles to persist in the population despite strong selection.

#### 3. Effect of Heterozygote Advantage on Allele Frequencies and Genetic Variation

- **Heterozygote Advantage:**
  - Allele frequencies of homozygotes converge to 0.5, regardless of initial frequencies.
  - The rare homozygote becomes more common until its frequency reaches 0.5, while the common homozygote becomes rarer until its frequency reaches 0.5.
  - The "R" and "S" alleles stabilize at 0.5 and are maintained in the population.
  - Heterozygotes increase in frequency, maintaining genetic variation.
  - Evolution occurs until allele frequencies stabilize; after stabilization, selection continues, but no further evolution occurs.

#### 4. Effect of Heterozygote Disadvantage on Allele Frequencies and Genetic Variation

- **Heterozygote Disadvantage:**
  - The more common homozygous allele will rise to a frequency of 1, while the rarer allele will drop to a frequency of 0.
  - A rare allele is more likely to be found in heterozygotes, while a common allele is more likely to be found in homozygotes.
  - This leads to a reduction in genetic variation as one allele becomes fixed in the population.

#### 5. Whether Selection Always Results in Evolution

- **Selection and Evolution:**
  - Selection does not always result in evolution.
  - In cases of heterozygote advantage, selection is against homozygote phenotypes, but allele frequencies stabilize, so evolution does not occur after stabilization.
  - Evolution is defined as a change in allele frequencies through generations.
  - Once allele frequencies stabilize, there is no further evolution despite ongoing selection.


### Guided Study Assignment Outcomes: Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)

#### 1. Genotype Frequencies Expected Under Genetic Equilibrium

- **Hardy-Weinberg Equation:**
  - \( p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 \)
  - \( p + q = 1 \)
  - Where \( p \) and \( q \) are the frequencies of the two alleles at a locus.
  
- **Genotype Frequencies:**
  - \( p^2 \): Frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype (AA).
  - \( 2pq \): Frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Aa).
  - \( q^2 \): Frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (aa).
  
- **Equilibrium Characteristics:**
  - Allele frequencies (\( p \) and \( q \)) remain constant from one generation to the next.
  - Genotype frequencies may change initially but will stabilize to \( p^2 \), \( 2pq \), and \( q^2 \) if the population is in equilibrium.

#### 2. Determining HWE Status from Observed Genotype Frequencies

- **Steps to Determine HWE:**
  1. **Calculate Allele Frequencies:**
     - \( p = \) Frequency of allele A.
     - \( q = \) Frequency of allele a.
  2. **Expected Genotype Frequencies:**
     - \( p^2 \) for AA, \( 2pq \) for Aa, \( q^2 \) for aa.
  3. **Compare Expected vs. Observed Frequencies:**
     - Use chi-square test to compare expected and observed frequencies.
     - If observed frequencies match expected frequencies, the population is likely in HWE.

#### 3. Conditions for HWE to Occur

1. **No Migration:**
   - The population is closed to migration from other populations.

2. **Infinite Population Size:**
   - The population is infinitely large to prevent genetic drift.

3. **No Mutation:**
   - No new alleles are introduced by mutation.

4. **Random Mating:**
   - All individuals mate randomly.

5. **No Selection:**
   - All genotypes in the population survive and reproduce equally well.

#### 4. Interpretation of HWE Status

- **Population in HWE:**
  - Genotype and allele frequencies remain constant from generation to generation.
  - Indicates no evolutionary forces (migration, mutation, selection, genetic drift) are acting on the population at that locus.

- **Population Not in HWE:**
  - Genotype and allele frequencies are changing from generation to generation.
  - Indicates that one or more evolutionary forces (migration, mutation, selection, genetic drift) are acting on the population at that locus.

#### 5. Factors Taking a Population Out of HWE

- **Gene Flow:**
  - Movement of organisms or their gametes from one population to another introduces new alleles.
  - Changes allele and genotype frequencies, moving the population away from HWE.

- **Genetic Drift:**
  - Random changes in allele frequencies due to chance events.
  - Reduces genetic variation, particularly in small populations, violating the assumption of an infinitely large population.
  - **Founder Effect:** A small group establishes a new population with limited genetic diversity compared to the original population.
  - **Bottleneck Effect:** Drastic reduction in population size due to events like disease or disaster, leading to loss of genetic diversity.

- **Mutation:**
  - Introduction of new alleles through changes in DNA sequences.
  - Alters allele frequencies, especially when mutations occur in germ-line cells.
  - **Types of Mutations:**
    - **Point Mutation:** Single nucleotide change.
    - **Insertion:** Addition of nucleotide base pairs.
    - **Deletion:** Removal of nucleotide base pairs.
    - **Inversion:** Reversal of a DNA segment.
    - **Duplication:** Copying of a DNA segment.

- **Selection:**
  - Differential survival and reproduction of genotypes.
  - Alters allele frequencies based on fitness differences.

<img src="/BIO1001/Cycle-6/3.png" width="70%" height=auto>

- **Non-Random Mating:**
  - Individuals select mates based on specific traits, not randomly.
  - Can lead to changes in genotype frequencies without altering allele frequencies.


#### 6. Types of Selection and Their Effects on Phenotype Distribution

- **Directional Selection:**
  - Favors one extreme phenotype, causing the population mean to shift.
  - Reduces genetic variability as the population adapts to environmental pressures.

- **Stabilizing Selection:**
  - Favors intermediate phenotypes, reducing extremes.
  - Increases the frequency of average phenotypes and reduces genetic variability.

- **Disruptive Selection:**
  - Favors extreme phenotypes over intermediates.
  - Can lead to a bimodal distribution and increased genetic variability.

#### 7. Importance of Diploidy and Balancing Selection in Maintaining Genetic Variation

- **Diploidy:**
  - Recessive alleles are hidden from selection in heterozygotes.
  - Preserves genetic variation by maintaining recessive alleles in the gene pool.

- **Balancing Selection:**
  - Multiple alleles are actively maintained in a population.
  - Types of Balancing Selection:
    - **Heterozygote Advantage:** Heterozygotes have a higher fitness than homozygotes.
    - **Frequency-Dependent Selection:** Fitness of a phenotype depends on its frequency relative to other phenotypes.

#### 8. Extra Definitions & Concepts

- **Inbreeding:**
  - Mating between genetically related individuals.
  - Increases homozygosity and can lead to inbreeding depression.

- **Sexual Selection:**
  - A form of natural selection where traits increase an individual's chances of mating.
  - Driven by male competition and female choice.

### Lecture 13 Outcomes: Fitness, Selection, and Genetic Variation

#### 1. Relative Fitness for Each Genotype

- **Relative Fitness:**
  - Measures the reproductive success of a genotype relative to the most successful genotype.
  - Calculated as the ratio of the absolute fitness of a genotype to the absolute fitness of the most successful genotype.
  - Always between 0 and 1.
  - Example: If genotype AA has the highest absolute fitness (W_AA = 1), and the absolute fitness of genotype Aa is W_Aa = 0.8, then the relative fitness of Aa is 0.8 / 1 = 0.8.

#### 2. Determining Type of Selection from Relative Fitness

- **Types of Selection:**
  - **Directional Selection:** One phenotype has a higher relative fitness, causing the allele frequency to shift in one direction.
  - **Stabilizing Selection:** Intermediate phenotypes have higher relative fitness, reducing the frequency of extreme phenotypes.
  - **Disruptive Selection:** Extreme phenotypes have higher relative fitness than intermediate phenotypes, leading to a bimodal distribution.

#### 3. Effect of Heterozygote Advantage or Disadvantage on Genetic Variation

- **Heterozygote Advantage:**
  - Maintains genetic variation by giving heterozygotes higher fitness.
  - Example: Sickle cell trait, where heterozygotes (AS) have a survival advantage in malaria-endemic regions.

- **Heterozygote Disadvantage:**
  - Reduces genetic variation as one allele becomes fixed and the other is lost.
  - The common homozygous genotype will increase in frequency, while the rarer allele will decrease.

#### 4. Effect of Genetic Drift on Allele Frequencies

- **Genetic Drift:**
  - Random fluctuations in allele frequencies due to chance events, particularly in small populations.
  - Causes unpredictable changes and reduces genetic variation over time.
  - Even without bottlenecks or founder effects, genetic drift can lead to the fixation or loss of alleles.

- **Inbreeding and Genetic Drift:**
  - Increases homozygosity by moving alleles from heterozygotes to homozygotes.
  - Can lead to inbreeding depression, lowering the overall fitness of the population.
  - Does not change allele frequencies but increases the proportion of homozygous individuals.

#### 5. Violations of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) and Agents of Microevolutionary Change

- **Agents of Microevolutionary Change:**

  | Agent          | Definition                                                  | Effect on Genetic Variation                | Effect on Average Fitness                    |
  |----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
  | Gene Flow      | Movement of alleles between populations                     | May introduce genetic variation           | Unpredictable effect; may introduce beneficial or harmful alleles |
  | Genetic Drift  | Random changes in allele frequencies                        | Reduces genetic variation, especially in small populations | Unpredictable effect; often harmful due to lost genetic diversity |
  | Natural Selection | Differential survival and reproduction                   | Can reduce or maintain allelic variation  | Positive effect through evolution of adaptations |
  | Mutation       | Heritable changes in DNA                                    | Introduces new genetic variation          | Unpredictable effect; most mutations in protein-coding genes lower fitness |

- **Signs of HWE Violation:**
  - Changes in genotype or phenotype frequencies from one generation to the next.
  - Significant deviations from expected HWE frequencies (p^2, 2pq, q^2).
  - Can indicate the presence of gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, selection, or non-random mating.
