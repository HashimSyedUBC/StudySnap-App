### Cycle 8: Species and Speciation

The concept of species is based on the perception that Earth’s biological diversity is packaged in discrete, recognizable units, rather than as a continuum of forms grading into one another.

#### Microevolution
- **Definition**: Changes in allele frequencies in a population over time.
- **Impact**: Differences evolving between populations may restrict gene flow.
- **Outcome**: Leads to macroevolution, resulting in the evolution of new species.

#### Speciation
- **Definition**: The process of species formation.
- **Importance**:
  - Identifying endangered species.
  - Recognizing species of concern.
  - Understanding where different species live on the planet.

#### Species Concepts

#### Evolutionary Species Concept
- **Definition**: Species are groups of organisms adapted to a particular set of resources (niche) in the environment.

#### Morphological Species Concept
- **Definition**: Species are defined by measurable traits that distinguish individuals from other species.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Similar physical characteristics.
  - Species are distinct clusters in phenotypic space, with no intermediates or overlap.
  - Can compare traits with fossils.
- **Limitations**:
  - Phenotypic variability is not considered.
  - Difficult to distinguish species that look very similar.
  - Provides little information on the evolutionary processes that produce new species.

#### Biological Species Concept
- **Definition**: Species are groups of interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from other groups.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Genetic cohesiveness: Populations of the same species experience gene flow, mixing their genetic material.
  - Genetic distinctness: Populations of different species are reproductively isolated and cannot exchange genetic information.
  - Provides the best evolutionary definition of a sexually reproducing species.
  - Testable and explains how species have evolved.
  - Investigates heritable traits, behavior, and physiology that lead to reproductive isolation.
- **Limitations**:
  - Does not apply to asexual life forms (e.g., most bacteria, archaeans, some protists, fungi, plants, and a few animals).
  - Not applicable to extinct organisms due to lack of reproductive habit data.

#### Phylogenetic Species Concept
- **Definition**: Species are the smallest aggregate populations united by shared derived characters.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Groups populations with a recent evolutionary history.
  - Smallest groups are more closely related to each other than to anything else.
  - Uses morphological and genetic information (molecular phylogenetics).
  - Applicable to any group of organisms, including extinct species and asexual reproducers.
- **Limitations**:
  - Molecular data is not possible from fossils.

### Convergent Evolution
- **Definition**: Similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share the same ancestry or common ancestor.
- **Example**: Eyes on top of the head in hippos and alligators.

### Subspecies
- **Definition**: A taxonomic subdivision of a species.

### Ring Species
- **Definition**: A species with a geographic distribution that forms a ring around uninhabitable terrain.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Considered one species with several subspecies.
  - Example: The lungless salamander *Ensatina eschscholtzii*.
    - Widely distributed in coastal mountains and Sierra Nevada of California, but cannot survive in the hot, dry Central Valley.
    - Seven subspecies differ in biochemical traits, color, size, and ecology.
    - Adjacent subspecies often interbreed where their geographical distributions overlap, but at the southern end of the Central Valley, adjacent subspecies rarely interbreed.
    - They have differentiated to such an extent that they can no longer exchange genetic material directly.

### Clinal Variation
- **Definition**: When a species is distributed over a large, environmentally diverse area, some traits may exhibit a cline—a smooth pattern of variation across a geographical gradient.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Results from gene flow between adjacent populations adapting to slightly different conditions.
  - Example: House sparrows (*Passer domesticus*) exhibit clinal variation in overall body size.

### Reproductive Barrier
- **Definition**: Prevents gene flow between populations.

#### Prezygotic Isolating Mechanisms
- **Definition**: Reproductive isolating mechanisms that act prior to the production of a zygote or fertilized egg.
- **Types**:
  - **Ecological Isolation**: Species live in the same geographic region but occupy different habitats (e.g., pond frogs vs. river frogs).
  - **Temporal Isolation**: Species live in the same habitat but breed at different times of day or year (e.g., mate at different times).
  - **Behavioral Isolation**: Species do not mate because of differences in courtship behavior (e.g., differences in mating calls).
  - **Mechanical Isolation**: Differences in the structure of reproductive organs prevent interbreeding.
  - **Gametic Isolation**: Incompatibility between the sperm of one species and the eggs of another prevents fertilization (gametes are not compatible).

#### Postzygotic Isolating Mechanisms
- **Definition**: Reproductive isolating mechanisms that act after zygote formation.
- **Types**:
  - **Hybrid Inviability**: Hybrid individuals have a low probability of survival to reproductive age.
  - **Hybrid Sterility**: Hybrid offspring cannot form functional gametes (e.g., horse x donkey = mule, which is sterile).
  - **Hybrid Breakdown**: Hybrids are capable of reproducing, but their offspring have reduced fertility or viability.

Note: These isolating mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and two or more of them may affect the outcome of interactions between species.

### Allopatric Speciation
- **Definition**: The evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms between two geographically separated populations.
  - Population is separated by a geological barrier.
- **Process**:
  1. Two populations become geographically separated, preventing gene flow.
  2. The populations experience distinct mutations, natural selection, and genetic drift, accumulating genetic differences that isolate them reproductively.
- **Commonality**: Most common mode of speciation in large animals.
- **Secondary Contact**: Interaction after a period of geographical isolation.
  - Tests if genes in the populations have diverged enough to make them reproductively isolated.
  - **Outcomes of Secondary Contact**:
    - Populations may resume interbreeding (fusion).
    - Populations may become partly or fully reproductively isolated.
    - Acts as a natural test to see if speciation has occurred.
- **Hybrid Zone**: Area where individuals of previously separated populations interbreed.
  - Hybrids have low fitness and are at risk of extinction.
- **Reinforcement**:
  - Accelerates isolation after secondary contact.
  - If postzygotic isolation has occurred, hybrids have lower fitness, so individuals who don’t hybridize are favored.
  - Promotes evolution of prezygotic isolation.
  - Encourages or establishes a pattern of behavior using a positive or negative stimulus.

### Sympatric Speciation
- **Definition**: Speciation occurring when two groups of the same species live in the same geographic location but evolve differently until they can no longer interbreed.
- **Mechanisms**:
  - Polyploidy: Offspring produced with twice the normal number of chromosomes.
  - Changes in chromosome structure or number (inversions, translocations, deletions, duplications).
    - Identified by comparing banding patterns in stained chromosome preparations from different species.

### Traits Involved in Reproductive Isolation
- **Factors**: Any differences in reproduction between individuals.
  - Structures, hormones, sperm recognition proteins, accessing resources, behavioral differences.
