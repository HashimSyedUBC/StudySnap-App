### Cycle 10: Diversity of Life

#### Meaning of Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA)
- **Definition**: The MRCA is the most recent individual from which all members of a group are directly descended.

#### Evolution of Life on Earth: Time Frame
- **Origin of Life**: 3.5-4 billion years ago, starting with single-celled organisms.
- **Major Eons**:
  - **Hadean**: 4.6-4 billion years ago
  - **Archean**: 4–2.5 billion years ago
  - **Proterozoic**: 2.5 billion – 541 million years ago
  - **Phanerozoic**: 541 million years ago - present

#### Characteristics of the Earliest Forms of Life
- **Size**: Small (1-2 nanometers)
- **Structure**: Single-celled, no external appendages, little internal structure, no nucleus.
- **Resemblance**: Similar to today's bacteria.
- **Classification**: Prokaryotes (meaning "before nucleus").

#### Origins of Mitochondria and Chloroplasts in Eukaryotic Cells
- **Mitochondria**:
  - Originated from an aerobic prokaryote engulfed by a eukaryotic cell.
  - Formed an endosymbiotic relationship with the host, evolving into mitochondria.
- **Chloroplasts**:
  - Eukaryotic cells with mitochondria engulfed photosynthetic prokaryotes.
  - These prokaryotes evolved into specialized chloroplast organelles.

#### The Three Domains of Life
  - *Archaea*
  - *Bacteria*
  - *Eukarya*

#### Differences Characterizing Organisms in the Three Domains
| Feature | Archaea | Bacteria | Eukarya |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DNA** | Circular chromosomes and plasmids | Mostly circular chromosomes and plasmids | Linear chromosomes, rarely plasmids |
| **Multicellular** | No | No | Yes |
| **Cell Wall** | Yes (without peptidoglycan) | Yes (with peptidoglycan) | Varies (plants and fungi have a cell wall, animals do not) |
| **Nucleus** | No | No | Yes |
| **Membrane-Bound Organelles** | No | No | Yes |
| **Cell Type** | Prokaryotic | Prokaryotic | Eukaryotic |

#### Characteristics of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)
- LUCA existed at the base of the tree of life and was the ancestor of all currently living organisms.

#### Finding the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) on a Phylogenetic Tree
- **Definition**: The youngest common ancestor shared by all individuals in a group.
- **Method**: Follow each taxon lineage back in time (towards the root of the tree) until all lineages converge.

#### Evidence for the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)
- **Habitat**: LUCA lived an "alien" like life, hidden deep underground in iron-sulfur-rich hydrothermal vents.
- **Metabolism**:
  - Anaerobic and autotrophic: Did not breathe air and made food from the dark, metal-rich environment.
  - Depended on hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, converting them into organic compounds like ammonia.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Small, single-celled organism.
  - Ring-shaped coil of DNA floating freely within the cell.
  - Morphologically similar to bacteria.

#### Evidence for the Bacterial Origins of Mitochondria and Chloroplasts in Eukaryotes
- **Origin**: Chloroplasts and mitochondria were once free-living bacteria.
- **Endosymbiotic Event**: 
  - Mitochondria formation occurred early in eukaryotic history.
  - Chloroplasts were integrated later.
- **Supporting Evidence**:
  - Both organelles have their own DNA, similar to bacterial DNA.
  - Similarities in DNA, RNA, ribosomes, chlorophyll (in chloroplasts), protein synthesis, and overall physical size.

#### Influence of Extinction Events on the Diversity of Life
- **Impact**:
  - **Species Reduction**: Mass extinction events reduce the number of species.
  - **Resource Availability**: Remaining species face less competition for resources and space.
  - **Evolutionary Opportunity**: Survivors have time to evolve, potentially leading to new species.
  - **Diversity and Distribution**: Extinctions alter animal distributions, ecosystems, and biogeography.

#### Role of Retroviruses in the Evolution of Mammals
- **Retrovirus Definition**: RNA viruses that insert a DNA copy of their genome into the host cell to replicate (e.g., HIV).
- **Placenta Evolution**:
  - A symbiotic retrovirus enabled the evolution of the placenta, allowing mammals to provide oxygen and nutrients to a fetus while keeping blood supplies separate.
  - Early mammals used viral "junk" DNA to help create the placenta.
  - Other symbiotic viruses contributed to the development of early human life and protection from pathogens.

#### Hominins and Characteristics of Early Hominins
- **Definition**: Hominins are a taxonomic tribe comprising species regarded as human, directly ancestral to humans, or closely related to humans.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Bipedalism**: Modified feet, thigh bone, pelvis, and spine for walking on two legs.
  - **Brain**: Large cerebral cortex (forebrain).
  - **Dentition**: Reduced canines and overall smaller teeth.
  - **Facial Features**: Prominent nose and chin, reduced eye ridges.
  - **Body Hair**: Short or very reduced, aiding in cooling.
  - **Skin**: Highly sensitive.
  - **Social Behavior**: Complex social interactions and behaviors.

#### Competing Hypotheses and Evidence on Dispersal of Early Humans
- **Hypotheses**:
  - **Out of Africa Hypothesis**: Suggests modern humans originated in Africa and then dispersed to other parts of the world.
  - **Multiregional Hypothesis**: Proposes that modern humans evolved simultaneously in different regions from existing hominid populations.

#### Evolutionary Relationships of Humans with Other Primates
- Humans share a common ancestor with other primates, particularly with chimpanzees and bonobos.
- **Key Evidence**:
  - **Genetic Similarity**: High percentage of shared DNA.
  - **Fossil Records**: Transitional fossils showing intermediate features.
  - **Behavioral Similarities**: Tool use, social structures, and communication methods.

#### Gene Flow between Homo Sapiens, Neanderthals, and Denisovans
- **Impact on Classification under Biological Species Concept**:
  - **Viability of Hybrids**: Evidence shows that hybrids between Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, and Denisovans were viable.
  - **Communication**: Likely, as they coexisted and interacted.
  - **Frequency of Interbreeding**: Genetic evidence indicates that interbreeding occurred but not frequently enough to classify them as the same species.

#### Species Concepts
- **Biological Species Concept (BSC)**:
  - **Definition**: A species is a group of populations whose members can interbreed and produce fertile offspring.
  - **Key Questions**:
    1. Were hybrids viable?
    2. Could they communicate with one another?
    3. Did interbreeding happen often?
- **Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC)**:
  - **Definition**: A species is the smallest group of individuals that share a common ancestor and possess certain defining traits.
- **Morphological Species Concept (MSC)**:
  - **Definition**: A species is defined by physical appearance, used for non-sexually reproducing organisms or fossils.

#### Human Traits with Rapid Recent Adaptive Evolution
- **High-Altitude Adaptation**: Improved oxygen utilization.
- **Freediving Ability**: Adaptation for prolonged underwater diving.
- **Disease Resistance**: Adaptation against diseases like malaria.
- **Lactase Persistence**: Ability to digest lactose into adulthood.

#### Arguments Against All Evolution Being Adaptive
- **Non-Adaptive Evolution**:
  - **Mutation**: Random changes in DNA.
  - **Migration**: Movement of individuals between populations.
  - **Genetic Drift**: Random changes in allele frequencies, especially in small populations.

#### Costs of Large Brains
- **Energetic Costs**:
  - Brains consume 2% of body weight but 20% of oxygen and energy.
- **Structural Costs**:
  - Larger brains make childbirth more difficult.

#### Hypotheses Explaining the Evolution of Large Brains
1. **Ecological Intelligence Hypothesis**:
   - Focuses on environmental challenges such as finding food, tool use, language, and planning.
   - Specialization in foraging cognition, knowledge of fruit properties, complex spatial representations, and good memory.
2. **Social Intelligence Hypothesis**:
   - Addresses the competitive and cooperative challenges of living with others.
   - Emphasizes cooperation, coordination, deception, manipulation, and understanding complex social situations.
3. **Cultural Intelligence Hypothesis**:
   - Combines ecological and social aspects.
   - Social learning of ecologically relevant skills, cooperative hunting, and building shelters.
4. **Mating Mind Hypothesis**:
   - Attributes brain evolution to the success in mating through art, wordplay, humor, and music.
