### Cycle 11 - Population Ecology

#### Population Growth Models
- **Definition**: Equations that describe how a population changes in size over time.
- **Purpose**: To predict future population sizes and compare growth rates across different organisms.

#### Exponential Growth
- **Conditions for Growth**:
  - Birth rate (including immigration) must be greater than the death rate (including migration).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Birth Rate per Capita**: Number of births per year divided by population size.
  - **Growth Rate per Capita (r)**: Difference between birth rate and death rate.
- **Equation**: Exponential population growth is calculated as \( r \times \text{population size} (N) \).
  - **Rmax**: The idealized maximum growth rate for an organism.
  - Organisms with shorter generation times typically have faster growth rates.
- **Resource Limitation**:
  - As the population grows, resources become more limited.
  - **Carrying Capacity (K)**: The maximum population size that an environment can support, limited by resources and competition (intraspecific).
    - Varies by habitat, season, etc.
    - Example: Species in harsher environments have lower carrying capacities compared to those in more favorable environments.
  - As the population approaches carrying capacity, growth slows down.

#### Logistic Growth
- **Characteristics**:
  - Growth rate slows as the population size approaches the carrying capacity.
- **Population Growth Curve**:
  - Adjusted for how close the population is to K.
  - Equation: \( r \times N \times \left(\frac{K - N}{K}\right) \).

#### Predicted Human Population Growth
- **Factors Influencing Carrying Capacity**:
  - Food availability, water supply, healthcare, education, contraceptive use, etc.

#### Trophic Roles
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Species exist as part of a larger system.
- **Multiple Roles**: One organism can fulfill multiple roles within an ecosystem.
- **Trophic Cascade**: Removal of one species can significantly impact the entire system.
- **Human Roles**: Humans occupy several trophic roles within food webs.

#### Interspecific Interactions
- **Predator-Prey**:
  - One organism eats another.
  - **Herbivory**: Consumption of plants or primary producers.
- **Competition**:
  - Two different species compete for a shared resource.

#### Symbiosis
- **Commensalism**: One species benefits while the other remains neutral.
- **Mutualism**: Both species benefit.
- **Parasitism**: One species benefits at the expense of the other.

#### Selective Pressures and Adaptations
- **Interactions**: Interactions between species exert strong selective pressures, leading to adaptations.
- **Microbial Influence**: Microbes on and in our bodies can produce neuromodulators (e.g., serotonin) that affect brain function, influencing emotions, stress response, and appetite.

#### Coevolution
- **Definition**: Interacting organisms evolve reciprocally.
- **Example**: 
  - Selection for longer tongues in moths leads to the selection for longer floral tubes in flowers, specializing the mutualistic interaction between them.

#### Host-Parasite Coevolution
- **Process**: 
  - Host produces antibodies against parasites (e.g., influenza virus).
  - Parasites evolve by replicating and mutating.
  - New strains may escape host immune responses, leading to an evolutionary arms race.

#### Anthropocene
- **Definition**: A new geological period marked by significant human impact.
- **Timeline**: Began approximately 500-70 years ago, potentially marked by the detonation of the first atomic bomb.
- **Significance**: 
  - May be identified by the 6th major mass extinction.
  - Increased extinction rates due to human activities (e.g., hunting).
  - Future rock layers may contain technofossils, evidence of human technological artifacts.
