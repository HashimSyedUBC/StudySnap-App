### Cycle 4 Outcomes

#### Prep. Lecture 8 Outcomes

**1. The Basic Mechanism of DNA Recombination in Meiosis**
- **Occurrence:** Recombination occurs during prophase I of meiosis.
- **Process:** 
  - Homologous chromosomes are paired tightly in tetrads.
  - Non-sister chromatids from each homologous chromosome exchange genetic information.
  - This exchange involves breaking covalent bonds in DNA backbones, removing DNA sequences, exchanging the ends between chromosomes, and then restoring the bonds.

**2. The Stage of Meiosis When Recombination Occurs**
- **Stage:** Recombination occurs during prophase I of meiosis.

### Lecture 8 Outcomes

**1. Mechanism of Substitution Mutagenesis During DNA Replication**
- **Process:**
  - Substituting a single base in one DNA strand results in initial damage.
  - After two rounds of replication, this becomes a double-stranded mutation.

**2. Mechanism of Insertion/Deletion (In/Del) Mutagenesis During DNA Replication Causing DNA Damage**
- **Susceptibility:** Repeating base sequences (e.g., many AT base pairs in a row) are more prone to causing issues.
- **Types of Slippage:**
  - **New Strand Slippage:**
    - Caused by looping in the new strand.
    - Repeating bases can cause one base to pop out, leading to an insertion of an extra nucleotide in the new strand.
    - This results in DNA damage, as the extra nucleotide will be paired with a complementary base in the next replication round, causing a double-stranded mutation.
  - **Template Strand Slippage:**
    - Caused by looping in the template strand.
    - Results in a missing nucleotide in the new strand, leading to a deletion.

**3. Mechanism of Chromosomal Rearrangements Resulting from Double Strand Breaks**
- **Types of Rearrangements:**
  - **Deletion:** A chromosome is broken and reassembled with one or more pieces missing.
  - **Duplication:** A chromosome is broken and reassembled with one or more pieces duplicated.
  - **Inversion:** A chromosome is broken and reassembled with one or more pieces inverted.
  <img src="/BIO1001/Cycle-4/2.png" width="40%" height=auto>
  - **Translocation:** A gene moves from one chromosome to another, potentially causing serious diseases if the gene moves from a low expression area to a high expression area.

**4. Role of UV, Ionizing Radiation, and ROS in Mutagenesis**
- **UV Radiation:**
  - UV photons can be absorbed by thymine bases.
  - This destabilizes electron clouds, causing adjacent thymine bases to form covalent bonds, creating thymine dimers.
  - Thymine dimers can be repaired by photolyase in some organisms, but mammals use excision repair.
  - **Photolyase:** Uses blue light to break the covalent bond between thymine dimers.
  - **Excision Repair:** Cuts out the thymine dimers and a few surrounding bases, then replaces them.

- **Ionizing Radiation:**
  - Has higher energy than UV radiation and can directly break DNA backbones.
  - Produced by the decay of elements like iodine and cesium.
  - **Iodine:** Builds up in the thyroid gland with a half-life of 1 week.
  - **Cesium:** Has a half-life of 30 years and is still present in areas like Chernobyl.

- **Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS):**
  - Ionization energy can cause water molecules in cells to lose electrons, making oxygen highly reactive.
  - ROS can break DNA backbones by colliding with them.
  - ROS causes deletions, duplications, inversions, or translocations by disturbing electron clouds in DNA nucleotides.
  - Double-stranded breaks can be repaired by non-homologous end joining.

**5. Evolutionary Advantages of Gene Duplication**
- **Survival and Selective Advantage:**
  - Allows for quicker protein production.
- **Variation:**
  - Provides the base material for evolution.
- **Gene Backup:**
  - Acts as a backup in case one gene fails.
- **Divergence:**
  - The duplicated gene can diverge, creating more genetic variability.

**6. Products of Meiosis in Animals vs. Plants, Fungi, and Algae**

**In Animals:**
- **Product:** Meiosis creates gametes.
- **Life Cycle:** Primarily multicellular diploid; haploid cycle is unicellular.

**In Plants and Some Fungi:**
- **Life Cycle:**
  - Both haploid and diploid stages are multicellular.
  - The sporophyte produces spores by meiosis, which undergo mitosis to produce the gametophyte.
  - The gametophyte produces gametes by mitosis, which fertilize to form the sporophyte.

**In Other Fungi:**
- **Life Cycle:**
  - The haploid life cycle is predominant; the diploid phase is unicellular while the haploid phase is multicellular.
  - The diploid zygote undergoes meiosis to produce haploid cells, which divide to form the gametophyte. The gametophyte undergoes mitosis to produce gametes.

**7. Timing of Meiosis in Vertebrate Life Cycles**
- **Mammalian Males:** Meiosis occurs continuously after sexual maturation.
- **Mammalian Females:** Meiosis begins during fetal development and cells remain in meiotic arrest until ovulation.

**8. Main Differences Between Meiosis and Mitosis**
- **Meiosis:**
  - Produces haploid cells (reduces chromosome number, n).
  - Involves two divisions.
  - Results in genetically different cells.
- **Mitosis:**
  - Retains the same chromosome number before and after division.
  - Involves one division.
  - Results in genetically identical cells.

**9. Characteristics of Homologous Chromosomes**
- Contain the same genes in the same order.
- May have different alleles.
- One chromosome is paternal, and the other is maternal.
- In prophase I, homologous chromosomes are held together by the synaptonemal complex, allowing chiasmata (crossing over) to occur.

**10. Reason Why Meiosis I is "Reductional" and Meiosis II is "Equational"**
- **Meiosis I:**
  - Reduces the chromosome number (n) from diploid to haploid (2n to n).
  - Reduces the DNA content (C) from 4C to 2C.
- **Meiosis II:**
  - Does not change the chromosome number (n).
  - Reduces the DNA content (C) from 2C to 1C.

**11. Changes in C and n During Meiosis**
- **Prophase I:** 4C and 2n
- **Telophase I:** 2C and n
- **Prophase II:** 2C and n
- **Telophase II:** 1C and n

<img src="/BIO1001/Cycle-4/4.png" width="40%" height=auto>

**12. Mechanism of Recombination During Prophase I**
- Cut one strand from each chromosome and reattach their ends by switching them.
- Cut the other strand and do the same.
- In total, four strands are cut and reattached.

**13. How Homologues Pair for Recombination**
- Homologues pair one on top of the other.
- All non-sister chromatids are touching and can recombine.

**14. Mechanism by Which Recombination Creates New Combinations of Alleles**
- Specific sections of a chromatid’s genome cross over with another chromatid.
- This creates random combinations of alleles passed down to daughter cells.

**15. Mechanism by Which Recombination Creates Copy Number Variation (CNV)**
- Changes in the number of copies of genes.
- New copies can evolve different functions, which may not be detrimental.
- Slippage can result in unequal crossing over; one chromosome ends up with extra genes, and the other with too few.

### Guided Study Assignment Outcomes

**1. Reason Why Meiosis I is "Reductional" and Meiosis II is "Equational"**
- **Meiosis I:** 
  - Reduces the chromosome number (n) from diploid to haploid (2n to 1n).
  - Reduces the DNA content (C) from 4C to 2C.
  - Homologous chromosomes are separated, so each daughter cell after meiosis I has only one complete set of chromosomes.
- **Meiosis II:**
  - Does not change the chromosome number (n).
  - Reduces the DNA content (C) from 2C to 1C.
  - Chromatids are separated from each other, halving the amount of DNA.

**2. Changes in C and n During Meiosis**
- **Premiotic Interphase:** 2n, 4C
- **Telophase I:** 1n, 2C
- **Telophase II:** 1n, 1C

**3. Mechanism of Recombination During Prophase I**
- **Process:**
  - Recombinase cuts a total of four backbones from all chromatids in a homologous pair.
  - Non-sister chromatids exchange ends and recombine.
  - Most recombination occurs in regions with similar sequences (homologous regions).
  - In total, four strands are cut and reattached.

**4. Role of Cohesin and Synaptonemal Complex**
- **Cohesin:** Holds sister chromatids together, which make up one chromosome of the homologous pair.
- **Synaptonemal Complex:** Holds homologous chromosomes together, allowing crossing over to occur by aligning them one on top of the other.

**5. How Homologues Pair for All Non-Sister Chromatids to Participate in Recombination**
- Homologues pair one on top of the other on the synaptonemal complex.
- This arrangement allows all non-sister chromatids to participate in recombination.

**6. Mechanism by Which Recombination Creates New Combinations of Alleles**
- **Process:**
  - Specific sequences of chromosomes code for certain genes.
  - Homologous chromosomes have different alleles for these genes.
  - In prophase I, recombination enzymes cut all four backbones from two homologous chromosomes and reattach their ends to opposite chromosomes.
  - Only specific sections of a chromatid’s genome cross over with another chromatid.
  - This creates random combinations of alleles passed down to daughter cells.

**7. Randomness of Alignment of Homologous Pairs at Metaphase I**
- **Independent Assortment:**
  - Maternal and paternal chromosomes align randomly, with each chromosome having a 50% chance of going to either pole.
  - This randomness creates genetic diversity in offspring.

<img src="/BIO1001/Cycle-4/6.png" width="40%" height=auto>

**8. Relationship Between Distance Separating Genes and the Likelihood of Recombination Between Them**
- **Frequency of Recombination:**
  - Genes close together have a low frequency of recombination because recombinase enzymes have difficulty accessing closely spaced genes.
  - Recombination events are more likely in areas with large distances between genes on chromatids.

**9. Meiosis as a Kind of DNA "Repair"**
- **Repair Mechanism:**
  - Recombination events during meiosis can "repair" mutated alleles by exchanging segments with other chromatids.
  - For example, if one homologue has a mutation in allele A and the other has a mutation in allele B, crossing over can produce a normal homologue for both A and B.

**10. Overall Mechanisms by Which Meiosis Generates Variation**
- Cutting and pasting maternal and paternal chromosomes so that segments of a maternal chromosome can attach to segments of a paternal chromosome.
- Random alignment and independent assortment of homologous chromosomes at metaphase I.
- Recombination and crossing over events during prophase I create new allele combinations and copy number variations (CNVs).


### Lecture 9 Outcomes

**1. Mechanisms Giving Rise to Variation in Meiosis**
- **Independent Assortment at Meiosis I:**
  - Homologous chromosomes align randomly at the metaphase plate.
  - This random alignment determines which combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes are passed to each daughter cell.
  - Creates genetic diversity by shuffling chromosomes.

- **Recombination in Prophase I:**
  - Homologous chromosomes pair and exchange segments.
  - This exchange generates new chromatids with unique combinations of alleles.
  - Creates genetic variation by producing new allele combinations.

**2. Mechanisms Giving Rise to Aneuploid Products of Meiosis**
- **Non-Disjunction:**
  - Can occur in either meiosis I or meiosis II.
  - **Meiosis I Non-Disjunction:**
    - Homologous pairs fail to separate and move to opposite poles.
    - Results in one daughter cell with an extra chromosome and one with a missing chromosome after meiosis I.
    - In meiosis II, chromatids of the unseparated homologous pair split normally, but the spindle apparatus cannot properly separate them due to the incorrect number of chromosomes.
  - **Meiosis II Non-Disjunction:**
    - Mis-division occurs when sister chromatids fail to separate.
    - Results in one daughter cell with an extra chromatid and one with a missing chromatid.

- **Aneuploidy:**
  - The result of non-disjunction or mis-division.
  - Causes daughter cells to have an abnormal number of chromosomes, either missing one or having an extra one.
  - Leads to genetic disorders and developmental abnormalities.
