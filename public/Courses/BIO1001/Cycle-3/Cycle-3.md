### Cycle 3 Notes: Repair of DNA Damage and Related Concepts

#### Chapter 11.4 – Repair of Damage in DNA

**Mutation vs. DNA Damage:**
- **Mutation:** A double-stranded change in the base sequence of a region of DNA.
- **DNA Damage:** Changes that affect only one strand of the double helix, such as replication errors or chemical modifications of bases.

**Types of Repair Mechanisms:**
1. **Proofreading:**
   - Performed by DNA polymerase.
   - Involves the removal of mispaired nucleotides from a newly synthesized DNA strand.
2. **Mismatch Repair:**
   - Removes mismatched bases from newly synthesized DNA strands.
3. **Excision Repair:**
   - Corrects various kinds of DNA damage, such as thymine dimers caused by chemicals and radiation.

**Basic Steps in DNA Error Correction:**
1. Recognition and removal of the DNA error.
2. Replacement of the removed DNA with new DNA using a repair DNA polymerase.
3. Sealing the new DNA to the old DNA using DNA ligase.

### Cycle 3 Outcomes

#### Prep. Lecture 6 Outcomes

1. **Mechanism of Proofreading:**
   - DNA polymerase rarely adds mismatched base pairs.
   - When mismatches occur, polymerases detect the errors and use built-in deoxyribonucleases to remove the incorrect bases and replace them with the correct ones.

2. **Mechanism of Mismatch Repair:**
   - Enzymes scan the DNA strand for distorted regions caused by mismatched bases.
   - Enzymes remove several bases around the mismatch, creating a gap.
   - DNA polymerase fills the gap, and DNA ligase seals the nick, completing the repair.
   - This mechanism also corrects mismatches such as thymine dimers, often caused by UV radiation.

#### Lecture 6 Outcomes

1. **Telomerase Action on Chromosome Ends:**
   - Telomerase extends the 3’ end of a chromosome using its RNA template.
   - The RNA template binds to the parent template and synthesizes new DNA.
   - This process repeats, extending the chromosome end for hundreds to thousands of times.
   - An RNA primer is added, and polymerase synthesizes more new DNA, leaving a single strand at the chromosome end.

2. **Trends in DNA Sequencing Costs:**
   - DNA sequencing costs have significantly dropped from $100M in 2001 to under $10k today due to technological advancements.

3. **Distribution of Genome Components:**
   - Over 55% of the genome consists of transposons, viruses, and "dead" genes (junk DNA).
   - 10% of the genome consists of introns (junk DNA).
   - 10% is essential DNA, with only 2% coding for proteins.
   - 25% of the genome is unknown, likely junk DNA.

4. **Proportion of Human Genome Coding for Protein:**
   - Only 2% of the human genome codes for proteins and human traits.
   - The majority of the genome is considered non-coding or "junk" DNA.


### Lecture 7 Outcomes: DNA Damage, Mutations, and Genomic Variations

#### 1. Difference Between DNA Damage and Mutation
- **DNA Damage:** 
  - A single-stranded change in the DNA, such as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or a thymine dimer caused by UV radiation.
  - Damage is not passed on genetically.
- **DNA Mutation:**
  - A double-stranded change in the DNA.
  - Mutations can be inherited.

#### 2. Types of Genomic Variation Among Humans
- **Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs):** 
  - Account for 1/4 of variations.
  - A single base change in the genome.
  - Occur from replication errors not fixed by proofreading and excision repair.
- **Copy Number Variations (CNVs):**
  - Account for 3/4 of variations.
  - Differences in the number of copies of a gene between individuals.
- **Retro Element Insertions:**
  - Variations in the amount of LINES and SINES among individuals.
- **De Novo Variations:**
  - New mutations not inherited from parents, about 100 per offspring.

#### 3. Unique SNPs in African Populations
- African populations have more unique SNPs due to their longer presence on Earth, leading to more time for divergence.
- African individuals show more genetic variation among themselves compared to non-African populations.
- This supports the theory that humans first evolved in Africa, and other populations diverged later.

#### 4. Differences Between Mobile Elements
- **Insertion Sequences:**
  - Simplest transposable elements in bacteria, containing transposase genes.
  - Move DNA within the genome using cut-and-paste or copy-and-paste mechanisms.
- **Transposons:**
  - Contain two insertion sequences flanking a general sequence.
  - Can move genes, often associated with antibiotic resistance, using cut-and-paste or copy-and-paste.
- **Retrotransposons:**
  - Transcribed into RNA and then reverse-transcribed into DNA.
  - Inserted into new genomic locations, similar to the mechanism of HIV.

#### 5. Why Mobile Elements Are Considered Biological Mutagens
- Mobile elements, also known as "jumping genes," move within the genome by reverse transcription.
- They can cause mutations by inserting into genes, altering their functions and creating genetic variability.

#### 6. Role of Tautomeric Shifts in Mutagenesis
- Tautomeric shifts alter base pairing, causing A to bind with C and G to bind with T.
- This results in SNP mutations after two rounds of replication.
- Tautomeric forms are not detected as mismatches because they maintain the correct number of hydrogen bonds.
- Chemical mutagens like 5-BromoUracil can induce tautomeric shifts, causing frequent mutations.

#### Big Ideas
- **Somatic Mutations:** 
  - Do not affect the next generation and do not impact human evolution.
- **Germline Mutations:** 
  - Occur in sex cells and are passed on to the next generation, contributing to genetic diversity and evolution.
