### Cycle 9 Outcomes
**Lecture 18 Outcomes**

#### 1. Meaning of Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA)
- **Definition**: The MRCA is the most recent individual from which all organisms in a group are directly descended.
- **Phylogenetic Tree**: MRCA occurs at nodes in a phylogenetic tree.
- **Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)**: 
  - LUCA is the common ancestor of all currently living organisms.
  - Exists at the base of the tree of life.
  - Any group's MRCA can be found by tracing phylogenetic branches back to their point of convergence.

#### 2. Misconception: "Humans are Descended from Chimps"
- **Clarification**: Humans are not descended from chimps.
- **Common Ancestor**: Humans, chimps, and bonobos share a common ancestor that did not exactly resemble any of these species but had common features.
  
#### 3. Traditional Groupings vs. Evolutionary Relationships
- **Reptiles**:
  - Traditional classification includes turtles, lizards, and crocodiles but excludes birds.
  - Some reptiles are more closely related to birds than to other reptiles.
- **Fish**:
  - Some fish are more closely related to humans than to other fish.
- **Conclusion**: Traditional groupings based on morphology may not accurately reflect evolutionary relationships because they often ignore genetic and evolutionary links.

### Guided Study Assignment Outcomes

#### 1. Criteria Used by Species Concepts
- **Morphological Species Concept**:
  - **Criteria**: Uses visible anatomical characteristics to classify species.
  - **Application**: Individuals of one species share measurable traits that distinguish them from other species.
- **Biological Species Concept**:
  - **Criteria**: Emphasizes genetic cohesiveness and distinctness.
  - **Application**: Members of the same species experience gene flow, whereas populations of different species cannot exchange genetic information.
  - **Interbreeding**: If two populations interbreed naturally and produce fertile offspring, they are part of the same species.
- **Phylogenetic Species Concept**:
  - **Criteria**: Uses morphological and genetic sequence data to construct evolutionary trees.
  - **Application**: Phylogenetic species share recent evolutionary history and are the smallest population that can be united through derived characteristics.
  - **Inclusivity**: Applicable to any group of organisms, including extinct and asexual species.

#### 2. Weaknesses/Limitations of Species Concepts
- **Morphological Species Concept**:
  - **Challenges**: Wide variety of traits could represent one species; cannot distinguish closely related species that look nearly identical; provides little insight into evolutionary processes.
- **Biological Species Concept**:
  - **Limitations**: Not applicable to asexually reproducing or geographically separated populations; not applicable to extinct organisms because their reproductive methods are unknown.
- **Phylogenetic Species Concept**:
  - **Difficulties**: Hard to apply to all forms of life since not all species have detailed evolutionary histories.

#### 3. Pre-Zygotic and Post-Zygotic Isolating Mechanisms
- **Pre-Zygotic Mechanisms**:
  - **Types**: Ecological, temporal, behavioral (signals between mates), mechanical, gametic (sperm and eggs incompatible).
- **Post-Zygotic Mechanisms**:
  - **Types**: Hybrid inviability (die as embryos or at a young age), hybrid sterility (develop but are sterile), hybrid breakdown (F1 generation is fertile but F2 has reduced survival or fertility).

#### 4. Allopatric and Sympatric Models of Speciation
- **Allopatric Speciation**:
  - **Definition**: Geographic isolation causes a population to split and diverge, creating new species through selection or genetic drift.
- **Sympatric Speciation**:
  - **Definition**: Speciation without geographic isolation (no barrier).

#### 5. Roles of Secondary Contact and Reinforcement in Allopatric Speciation
- **Reinforcement**:
  - **Definition**: Occurs when two populations come back together and have become postzygotically isolated, leading to the evolution of prezygotic isolation mechanisms.
  - **Outcome**: Females are more fit if they mate assortatively.
- **Secondary Contact**:
  - **Early Contact**: Can result in species collapse.
  - **Late Contact**: Can result in reinforcement, leading to prezygotic isolation.
  - **Speciation**: Occurs when populations of the same species become geographically isolated, preventing genetic interchange. Secondary contact is not required for speciation, but if it occurs, the Biological Species Concept (BSC) can be used to determine if they interbreed.

#### 6. Causes of Speciation
- **Genetic Divergence in Allopatry**:
  - **Mechanism**: Geographic isolation leads to genetic divergence through selection or genetic drift.
- **Polyploid Mutations in Sympatry**:
  - **Mechanism**: Polyploidy creates reproductive isolation between the polyploid individual and the original population because the zygotes will not have the correct number of chromosomes.
- **Chromosome Alterations**:
  - **Mechanism**: Changes in chromosome structure can lead to reproductive isolation and speciation.

### Lecture 19 Outcomes

#### 1. Identifying Species Concepts in Real-World Examples
- **Morphological Species Concept (MSC)**:
  - **Example**: Happy face spiders are considered different species under MSC because they look different.
- **Biological Species Concept (BSC)**:
  - **Example**: Happy face spiders are considered the same species under BSC because they interbreed.
- **Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC)**:
  - **Example**: Many groupings categorized as "subspecies" by BSC are monophyletic under PSC and would be recognized as species.
    - **Impact**: This radically changes our current understanding of species. For instance, song sparrows have 20 different species in North America under PSC but only 1 species under BSC.

#### 2. Necessity of Secondary Contact for Speciation
- **Allopatric Speciation**:
  - **Definition**: Occurs when populations of the same species become geographically isolated, preventing genetic interchange.
  - **Process**: What was originally one population separates into distinct populations and diverges; genetic drift can change allele frequencies in these populations.
- **Secondary Contact**:
  - **Not Required**: Speciation can occur without secondary contact.
  - **Assessment**: If two populations come into secondary contact (e.g., if a barrier disappears), BSC can be used to determine if they interbreed. Speciation can still occur without secondary contact, but it helps in identifying species using BSC.

#### 3. Effects of Secondary Contact on Speciation
- **Species Collapse**:
  - **Scenario**: If populations don't have enough time to diverge, coming into secondary contact can lead to species collapse, stopping any speciation that has begun.
- **Reproductive Isolation**:
  - **Scenario**: If populations have been diverging for long periods, they may become partly or completely reproductively isolated.
- **Reinforcement**:
  - **Definition**: Selection favors the evolution of prezygotic isolation, leading to preferential mating within one's own population.
  - **Advantage**: If populations come back into secondary contact and postzygotic isolation has occurred, individuals who avoid hybridizing have a selective advantage.
  - **Outcome**: Secondary contact can either accelerate speciation through reinforcement or undo speciation through interbreeding, depending on whether post-zygotic isolation has been achieved.
